# Stat equations

- 1 STAM = 10 HP
- 1 STR = 1 Melee Damage
- 1 AGI = 1 Ranged Damage and 1 Dodge Chance
- 1 INT = 1 Magic Damage and 10 MP
- 1 Armor = 1 Damage Reduction
- 1 Resistance = 1 Magic Damage Reduction

# Damage calculation

- Melee Damage = STR * 1 + Weapon Damage - Enemy Armor = Total Damage Dealt (Physical)
- Ranged Damage = AGI * 1 + Weapon Damage - Enemy Armor = Total Damage Dealt (Physical)
- Magic Damage = INT * 1 + Spell Damage - Enemy Resistance = Total Damage Dealt (Magical)


- Dodge Chance = AGI * 1 = % Chance to Dodge
- Critical Chance = 5% Base + AGI * 0.1 = % Chance to Crit (Max 50%) (Physical only)
- Block Chance = 5% Base + STR * 0.1 = % Chance to Block (Max 50%) (Only if shield equipped)
- Parry Chance = 1% Base + AGI * 0.1 = % Chance to Parry (Max 30%) (Only if dual-wielding)
